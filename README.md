## 📝 Notes
- The app will be available on the Play Store soon..
- Fetching spent time from the Altissia may not work sometimes at day time due to the platform's restrictions (i don't know why, but it works fine at night during my tests 🤷‍♂️)
- The app is not open-source, but the code is available for review upon request.

## 🎯 Yes, it works
> ### I have tested the app by letting it run while I sleep 😴
